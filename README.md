# Programming Challenges

My solutions to various problems posted on the [Programming Challenges](http://www.programming-challenges.com) website and mentioned in the Programming Challenges book.

It is worth noting that the judge is rather limited and therefore, my Java solutions have the following limitations:
* Written in Java 1.6
* All files are simply titled Main.java
* All code is included in a single file
* Unit Tests are commented out to prevent the judges compiler from breaking
```
