# Programming Challenges

My solutions to various problems posted on the [Programming Challenges](http://www.programming-challenges.com) website and mentioned in the Programming Challenges book.

It is worth noting that the judge is rather limited and therefore, my Java solutions have the following limitations:
* Written in Java 1.6
* All solutions are simply titled Main.java
* All tests are simply title MainTest.java
* The package declaration must be removed for the program to be run by the judge
```
